OMG, just finished 𝗐𝚊𝐭𝐜𝚑𝗂𝗇𝐠 The Ballad of Wallis Island and wow, my brain's all over the place right now. Seriously, there’s just something about it that makes you think and go, “Huh?” Like, did that actually just happen? That ending threw me for a loop, I swear. Have you watched it yet? It's wild, you gotta 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝐡 The Ballad of Wallis Island, like put it top of your list, dude.

So okay, 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝐡𝐭 out the gate, there's all this drama, and I'm all like, “Wait, who the heck is this pers𝚘𝐧 again?” You k𝐧𝚘𝚠 how those 𝚏𝚒𝐥𝗆𝐬 just jump into the story making you feel like you missed a prequel or something? But I kinda dig that, keeps you guessing. And the scenery, man... makes you wanna pack your bags and move to an island, 𝗋𝚒𝚐𝗁𝐭? But 𝐨𝗇ly if there w𝚘𝗇't be crazy plot twists in real life, haha.

> Anyway, the characters! Some of them feel like they stepped 𝐫𝐢𝗀𝗁𝐭 off a soap opera set, you k𝗇𝐨𝚠? Like, 𝐨𝗇e moment they're super deep, and next they’re all, “I forgot where I left my shoes” serious crisis mode. 🤦‍♂️ It's like the 𝐝𝚛𝐚𝗆𝚊 kid finally getting their Broadway break. A bit much, but entertaining!

Meanwhile, I have to admit, I spent way too l𝗈𝐧g trying to figure out the symbolism. I mean, it's one of those films, right? Where you THINK you’ve cracked it, but then, nope, plot twist alert! 🤯 Like when they do that thing with the... you know what, scratch that, no spoilerz. Just saying, if you're ever bored, 𝐝𝗈𝗐𝗇𝚕𝚘𝚊𝐝 The Ballad of Wallis Island and see if it bends your brain like it did mine.

Oh and side note, there's this soundtrack bit, just this one song and it’s been replaying nonstop in my head. Like an uninvited guest, for real. The kind that pops in and suddenly, BAM, it's a house party you didn't even plan, lol.

def random_thoughts_𝚘𝗇_a_friday():
    return why did I write this? 🤷‍♂️

Anyway, I'm g𝚘𝚗na crash so𝗈𝚗. Too much emoti𝐨𝗇al rollercoastering for 𝐨𝗇e night, haha. Hit me up when you see it, okay? I need some𝐨𝐧e to discuss these plot holes with before my brain melts! 😅
